  summary: 'Statically (constexpr) generate interpolating polynomial and associated numerical scheme from linear constraints'
  description: |
    The goal of this C++17 library is to statically (eventually at compile-time) generate stencils involved in finite differences and finite volumes schemes that are based on polynomial interpolation.
    An interpolation polynomial is generated by solving a set of linear equations defined by some operations (evaluation, derivation, integration, ...) applied to a canonical polynomial.
    Once generated, this interpolation polynomial can be used as it (general formulation of the interpolation) or can be derivated and evaluated at a given point so that to recover the associated numerical scheme stencil.
    The coefficients are computed in the rational space so that to avoid numerical precision issues (except integer overflow).
